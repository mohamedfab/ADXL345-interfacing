# ADXL345-interfacing
The ADXL345 is a low-power, 3-axis MEMS accelerometer modules with both I2C and SPI interfaces. 
The ADXL345 features 4 sensitivity ranges from +/- 2G to +/- 16G. And it supports output data rates ranging from 10Hz to 3200Hz.
Here, we interface this chip using SPI serial protocol using ATMEGA32A microcontroller from microchip(ATMEL).
